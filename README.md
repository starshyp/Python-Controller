# Rocket-Elevators-Python-Controller
This program to develop is a controller set up in a residential building that contains more than one floor and elevators. This controller is capable of supporting two main events:

1. A person presses a call button to request an elevator, the controller selects an available cage and it is routed to that person based on two parameters provided by pressing the button:
    * The floor where the person is
    * the direction in which he wants to go (Up or Down)

2. A person enters an elevator, selects a floor of the control panel and it moves to the floor requested. The parameter provided is the requested floor.
